# Game Trainer Tutorial

## Introduction
### What are we doing here?
Twelve year old me would be beyond hype by the thought of me writing this, he also would've been hype had he found a tutorial like this in his youth, so he'd know how to do this a decade and a half earlier. 
<br>Do what exactly? Make a 'Game Trainer' in C++.<br> 
For those not in the know, a game trainer is a program that edits the memory of another process to affect the way in which the program works, most commonly to give infinite money, or provide some kind of
invincibility. The term trainer is cope for cheating, which is naughty in multiplayer games. This method won't work in multiplayer games anyway. 
<br>This tutorial will use Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic as an example, but any 32-bit Singleplayer game on Windows should work perfectly fine. 
### Who is this tutorial for?
Realistically speaking, anyone who is semi-competent with a "lower level" programming language should find this project relatively trivial, and will likely have all the prerequisite knowledge to do this WITHOUT this
tutorial. Consequently, this is going to be a beginner friendly tutorial. But you should at least:
* Have some experience with C++, or a similar language.
* Have an above average understanding of how computers use memory (this bar is much lower than it sounds).
* Possess a level of patience. Even for people who know what they're doing, this process takes a while.
### Who this tutorial is not for:
* Experienced Programmers.
* People who want to write "hacks" for online games.
* People who want to learn "malware", why you would want this is beyond me, but this method won't work.<br><br>


This isn't YouTube, so I've likely provided too long a preamble by now. Let's just get started.
